      <h1>Information About me</h1>
      <p class="me"> My name is Mohammad Abozamel . I am 33 years old, I was born in Syria and I studied English Literature in Damascus university . now I live In Holland from about 3 years and I learned Dutch in level b1 and I wished to do something suitable taking into account my abilities and the need of labor market. I find programming and web development beautiful and think that I can do and it is important for the labor market .
I have been interested in the computer since I was young.  
My first step was that I began to learn about software and how I can deal with programs , windows and the problems that can face the users of computer such as download software , formatting, windows installing or if someone want to download program which it has difficult crack , break the password for windows , replace the computer parts . Briefly I worked in repair computers until I emigrated from Syria ..
I had a Photoshop course and I learned a little bit over Corel draw , I had web design course and we used at that time front page program then I began to pay attention to the content of programs and how to give orders in programs …..
 I thought over the needs of society especially here in Holland , over what I can do and suitable for me and I found programming and web development the best choice in this time .
Now I started to look at the lessons and courses over Java and HTML – CSS – MYSQL – and I hope that I can earn a little experience for I begin the course with Hack Your Future . 

If I became a good programmer I would like to build an application  to help refuges to know the best choice in the problems and challenges that they face them such as study , work , acquaintance and social relations .
I also want to make an application to help the communities in Europe to know more over the refuges such as the traditions , morals , religion , educations and the reasons of migration .
I don’t hide my desire to work in web development as well and make my website to build professional websites for the company of shops .  
In fact the options and thoughts are open always with programming  and web development .
